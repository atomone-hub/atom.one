Shaped through community discussion and validator coordination, [the AtomOne v2 upgrade](https://gov.atom.one/proposals/8) proposal that just passed introduces important architectural changes and a refined economic design. It also lays the groundwork for a more scalable, modular network, which sets the foundation for the network’s next phase of growth. At the center of this release is PHOTON, a dedicated fee token that reflects AtomOne’s vision for clearer token roles and a more robust system.

## A Dual-Token Model with Clear Roles

In the AtomOne v2 system, ATONE and PHOTON [serve distinct purposes](https://atom.one/blog/the-utility-of-the-atom-and-atone-staking-tokens/). ATONE acts as the governance and staking token, securing the network and enabling participation in on-chain decision-making. PHOTON is intended to be used exclusively for transaction fees. This separation could help avoid common challenges seen in single-token models.

PHOTON can **only** be minted by burning ATONE. This process is **irreversible**. Minting PHOTON reduces ATONE’s circulating supply and ties PHOTON’s creation of a maximum of 1 billion PHOTONS directly to it.

## A Gradual Transition to PHOTON for Fees

PHOTON is intended to eventually become the sole fee token across the AtomOne network, including the root chain, potential future core shards, IBC, and ICS. However, the transition will happen in stages rather than immediately.

With the v2 upgrade, both ATONE and PHOTON can be used to pay for transaction fees during a transition period. This transition period allows users to adjust to using PHOTON for fees and contributors to update tools and integrations. A future governance proposal will be required to update fee parameters and fully complete the transition. This phased approach could help ensure a smoother migration while preserving community oversight.

## A Community-Built Rollout

The upgrade followed AtomOne’s governance process from start to finish. It began with a signaling proposal on the [Commonwealth forum](https://common.xyz/atomone/discussion/26026-signaling-proposal-to-add-the-photon-token), continued through revisions based on community feedback, and was finalized with an on-chain vote. Validators coordinated the rollout after the vote passed.

Although v2 is live, the final step to make PHOTON the exclusive fee token still depends on a future governance decision. This next phase will continue to be shaped by the AtomOne community and implemented by a decentralized validator set committed to the network’s long-term vision.

In parallel, community contributors have developed tools to support the transition. Several dashboards are now available to help users monitor and perform ATONE-to-PHOTON conversions with greater transparency and ease. These efforts reflect the broader community’s role in governance and creating practical infrastructure that supports adoption and long-term usability. You can find those here: moonkit / nodeist / etc

AtomOne v2 represents another step forward in building a decentralized, resilient network shaped by its community. As the transition to PHOTON progresses and new proposals take shape, AtomOne continues to explore how thoughtful design can strengthen blockchain ecosystems for the long term.
